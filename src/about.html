        <p>Aleena Winward is the owner of The Quilting Bee in Wellsville. She started a machine
          quilting business in her home in 2011 using her Gammill Vision 30-12 for hand-driven machine
          quilting. She is a certified machine quilter with training from Village Dry Goods and Rocky Mountain Electric Quilters. She has enjoyed learning in classes she's taken from many wonderful teachers at local quilt shops and local quilt guilds in Cache Valley. She enjoys free motion quilting overall patterns best.</p>

      <h2>The Origins</h2>
      <p>Quilting is part of Aleena's heritage. Her grandma made hundreds of quilts by hand for her family. Grandma taught Aleena about quilting and helped her make her first t-shirt quilt. When Aleena got her longarm quilting machine, she felt as though she had come home and knew grandma must be smiling in Heaven. With the help of her quilting machine, Aleena can quilt more quilts than even grandma had, with sturdier stitches. She owes her love of quilting to grandma!</p>
